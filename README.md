 Java Developer Internship – Daily Progress Log (June 2025) This repository documents my day-to-day technical tasks, learnings, and contributions during my Java Developer Internship for the month of June 2025. It serves as a transparent and organized record of my practical experience, showcasing both my coding skills and professional development.
Task 1 – Java Console Calculator
A simple yet robust console-based calculator built using Java. This project demonstrates core programming concepts through the implementation of fundamental arithmetic operations in a user-interactive command-line interface.
Key Features
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Clean modular structure with separate methods for each operation

Uses Scanner for user input handling and switch-case for flow control

Includes input validation and division-by-zero error handling

Learning Outcomes
Practiced procedural and modular programming in Java

Improved command-line application design

Gained hands-on experience with Java's control statements and exception handling

Task 2 – Student Record Management System
A menu-driven application to manage student data such as ID, name, and marks using CRUD operations in a console environment. Developed in Java using object-oriented principles and dynamic data storage with ArrayList.

Core Features
Create, view, update, and delete student records

Encapsulated Student class with getters/setters and constructors

Interactive CLI menu using do-while and switch-case

Real-time data manipulation without persistent storage

Learning Highlights
Applied OOP concepts like encapsulation and constructors

Implemented practical CRUD logic for real-time data handling

Strengthened data structure usage (ArrayList) for dynamic record management
