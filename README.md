# ELEVATE-LABS-
 Java Developer Internship – Daily Progress Log (June 2025) This repository documents my day-to-day technical tasks, learnings, and contributions during my Java Developer Internship for the month of June 2025. It serves as a transparent and organized record of my practical experience, showcasing both my coding skills and professional development.
Task 1 – Java Console Calculator
A simple yet robust console-based calculator built using Java. This project demonstrates core programming concepts through the implementation of fundamental arithmetic operations in a user-interactive command-line interface.
Key Features
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Clean modular structure with separate methods for each operation

Uses Scanner for user input handling and switch-case for flow control

Includes input validation and division-by-zero error handling

Learning Outcomes
Practiced procedural and modular programming in Java

Improved command-line application design

Gained hands-on experience with Java's control statements and exception handling

Task 2 – Student Record Management System
A menu-driven application to manage student data such as ID, name, and marks using CRUD operations in a console environment. Developed in Java using object-oriented principles and dynamic data storage with ArrayList.

Core Features
Create, view, update, and delete student records

Encapsulated Student class with getters/setters and constructors

Interactive CLI menu using do-while and switch-case

Real-time data manipulation without persistent storage

Learning Highlights
Applied OOP concepts like encapsulation and constructors

Implemented practical CRUD logic for real-time data handling

Strengthened data structure usage (ArrayList) for dynamic record management
Here is a professional, consistent explanation for **Task 4 – NotesApp (Java File I/O)** to include in your internship GitHub repository:

 Task 4 – NotesApp (Java File I/O)

A text-based Notes Manager application developed in Java that allows users to create and view personal notes through a simple command-line interface. This task focuses on the use of file I/O operations for persistent data storage and retrieval, applying core Java concepts like exception handling and resource management.
 Core Features

* Append notes to a local text file (`notes.txt`) using `FileWriter`
* View all stored notes using `BufferedReader` and `FileReader`
* User-friendly CLI with a menu-driven interface (add/view/exit)
* Error handling for file access and I/O operations
* Uses `try-with-resources` for automatic stream management

 Learning Highlights

* Learned how to read from and write to files in Java
* Gained practical experience with `FileWriter`, `FileReader`, and `BufferedReader`
* Understood exception handling patterns using `try-catch` and `try-with-resources`
* Practiced file persistence to simulate real-world data storage
* Reinforced Java fundamentals such as `Scanner` input, control flow (switch-case), and loop constructs

Technical Focus

This task was designed to simulate a basic data persistence mechanism without using databases. It introduced core Java file I/O streams and promoted good coding practices for resource and error management. The implementation supports extensibility for future enhancements such as note editing, deleting, or timestamping.

Task 5 – BankApp (Java OOP Simulation)
A simple command-line banking application built using Java OOP principles. The app allows users to deposit, withdraw, and view their transaction history with a menu-driven interface.

 Core Features
* Account and SavingsAccount classes using inheritance

* Deposit and withdraw with validation

* Show balance and transaction history

* Method overriding for withdrawal rules

* Menu-driven CLI

Learning Highlights
* Practiced inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding

* Simulated real-world banking with object-oriented design

* Strengthened use of loops, conditions, and class structures

Technical Focus
Focused on OOP design, simulating real scenarios without persistence. Prepares for future upgrades like file saving or account management systems.
